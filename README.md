# lxc-pihole-exporter

A Debian LXC image containing the Prometheus [Pihole Exporter](https://github.com/eko/pihole-exporter).

## Configuration

Set `/opt/pihole_exporter/.env` accordingly

## Why?

I run a Home Lab on Proxmox and my preference is to manage CTs rather than a VM or CT running Docker images (with something like Portainer).
